# Boyuan's Homepage

Hi, here is Boyuan's Homepage.

I am currently an MPhil student at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html), [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). My research focuses on deep learning, particularly in biomedical image analysis, with an emphasis on synthesizing high-quality PET images from low-dose PET images.

I hold a Master of Data Science from the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the [School of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://smcs.ncu.edu.cn/xygk/xyts/), [Nanchang University](https://www.ncu.edu.cn/).
